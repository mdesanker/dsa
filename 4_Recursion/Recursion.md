# Recursion

A process (a function) that calls itself

- Sometimes a cleaner alternative to iteration

## Requirements for recursive function

1. Invoke the same function with a different input until you reach your base case
2. Must have a base case - condition when the recursion ends

- Helper method recursion - outter function calls an internal recursive function

  - Usually when need to compile array or list of data

- Pure recursion - self-explanatory
