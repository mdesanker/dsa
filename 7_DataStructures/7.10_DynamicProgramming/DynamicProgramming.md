# Dynamic Programmin

- Method for solving complex problems by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems, solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solutions

## Overlapping Subproblems

- Can break down into subproblems which are reused several times

## Optimal Substructure

- If an optimal solution can be constructed from optimal solution of its subproblems

## Memoization

- Storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the inputs occur again

## Tabulation - A Bottom Up Approach

- Usually done with iteration, starting with smallest subproblem

- Better space complexity can be achieved using tabulation
