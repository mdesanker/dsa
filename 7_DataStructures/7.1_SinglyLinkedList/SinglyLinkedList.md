# Singly Linked List

- Contains head, tail, and length property

- Consists of nodes, and each node has a value and a pointer to another node or null (tail)

## Lists

- Do not have indexes
- Connected via nodes with a next pointer
- Random access is not allowed
- Ideal for insertion and deletion

## Arrays

- Indexed in order
- Insertion and deletion can be expensive
- Can be quickly access at a specific index

## Big O

- Insertion - O(1)
- Removal - O(1) or O(n)
- Searching - O(n)
- Access - O(n)

## Recap

- Singly linked lists are an excellent alternative to arrays when insertion and deletion at the beginning are frequently required

- Arrays contain a built in index, whereas linked lists do not

- The idea of a list data structure that consists of nodes is the foundation for other data structures like stacks and queues
