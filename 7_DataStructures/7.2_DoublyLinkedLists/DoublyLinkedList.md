# Doubly Linked list

- Same as singly linked list, but with additional pointer to the previous node

- Comparison to singly linked lists: More memory === More flexibility

## Big O Notation

- Insertion - O(1)
- Removal - O(1)
- Searching - O(n) (O(n/2) simplifies to O(n))
- Access - O(n)

## Recap

- Doubly linked lists are almost identical to singly linked lists, except there is an additional pointer to previos nodes

- Finding nodes can be done in half the time

- Take up more memory considering the extra pointer
