# Searching

## Linear Search

Check every element one at a time

- Necessary if elements are not sorted

## Binary Search

Eliminate half of remaining elements at a time (divide and conquer)

- Array MUST be sorted

## Naive String Search

Count number of times a substring appears in a larger string
